            <h3>My Family's Travel Adventures in Different Countries</h3>
            <p>Stepping out from one's comfort zone can be liberating. It builds your resilience, objectiveness and
            tolerance. It allows you to be accepting of cultural differences. It builds your character in a way only
            experiences can.  Living in different countries for a period of time gives you that experience.  You get to experience life as a local rather than as a tourist.  You get to see both the good side and the bad side (which so far has not really been worst than a few inconveniences) of living as a local.</p>

            <h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
            <p>Japan is where our first adventure began. My husband got an intra-transfer assignment to his company's
            headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. We had most of our first experiences there. Our first international flight. Our
            first train ride. Our first zoo experience. Our first themepark experience (our first Disneyland experience
            too!). Japan have a good government support for gaijins (this is the Japanese term for foreigner). My eldest
            daughter went to public school and was provided a private tutor to brush up on her Nihonggo (Japan's language).
            There was also a free language learning center that caters to adults who wants to learn the Japanese language.
            The high regard I have for Japan was brought about our experience in their country.

            <h3>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</h3>
            <p>Malaysia was a different experience for us. My husband made a big leap in his career and changed employer
            after 8 years with his previous company. We lived in the middle of Kuala Lumpur and had a good view of the
            Petronas Tower from our condo. At this time, we had 3 girls. The youngest still running 2 at the time. I
            also homeschooled the girls because the country's public school uses Bahasa (Malaysia's language) as the
            medium of
            instruction. Private school on the other hand is not an option ($$$). While Malaysia served as a good ground
            for my husband to grow in his career, I didn't find it conducive for raising a family (especially when
            you're a foreigner who don't want to pay $$$ for good education).

            <h3>Tampa, Florida, USA</h3>
            <p>We were working on our immigration to Canada when the work opportunity in the US for my husband happened. We
            had to make a tough decision and eventually decided on taking up the opportunity in the US. At this time,
            you guessed it right! we have 4 beautiful girls. My youngest was 7 months old when she took her first plane
            ride. It wasn't as bad as I imagined. She was a trooper the whole time. This stint in the US turned out to
            be something we are looking at permanently settling in. The girls have adjusted well in the public schools.
            They made friends and are at the top of their classes. My husband's employer is one of the best in the
            industry. I landed an opportunity to get into the world of coding which was made possible by LaunchCode. I
            couldn't be more grateful to be part of the program and I am positive that this will launch me into a great
            career in software development.
